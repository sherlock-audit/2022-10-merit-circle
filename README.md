# About Merit Circle

> source: [Merit Circle Docs](https://meritcircle.gitbook.io/merit-circle/)

Merit Circle is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that creates opportunities for crypto and gaming enthusiasts. Together, we are building the metaverse. This is done through investments in the gaming industry and by dispensing the DAO's assets to our gamers, creators and contributors that are spread across the world. The platform we are building hosts gaming opportunities, educational content and everything else a person could need to begin their journey in the decentralized gaming industry.

The Merit Circle DAO consists of a mainDAO governing over numerous subDAOs that function like tentacles, spreading across the gaming industry. The DAO is maintained by various independent parties and individuals through governance, empowering holders through the $MC token. Since the emergence of the Merit Circle DAO, a great focus has been placed on diversification. This not only means diversifying our portfolio of games but also our infrastructure partners.

As the DAO has grown and evolved, so too has our ability to support, create and positively influence the GameFi industry. To keep up with the ever-changing dynamics of this space, we decided to reorient our vision in creating a DAO that focuses on sustainability, based on four verticals. Each vertical was created from the basis of our experience in the introductory phase of the DAO and addresses an area in which we feel we can further improve on existing operations.
